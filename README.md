# GestureControl-LED
This project is used to enhance the functionality between OpenCV and Arduino.
The project could be used as an educational tool to demonstrate the integration of computer vision (OpenCV), hand tracking (MediaPipe), and hardware control (Arduino).
The finger-controlled LEDs could be integrated into a larger system for controlling devices or appliances using gestures.
